  <p align="justify">Hello there! My name is Andualem Girma Kefeni, I am a recent Master of Science graduate from the University of California Berkeley in Systems Engineering (concentration in Data Science). I am a MasterCard scholarship recipient at the university, which is among the most prestigious awards offered by the university.<br/><br/>
In addition to working as a research assistant on the SWITCH-china project, A Systems Approach to De-carbonize Chinaâ€™s power system, I was also a student assistant at Berkeley International Office, University of California Berkeley.<br/><br/>
I have a background in Civil engineering with more than two years of experience in structural design and cost estimation. I have also been involved in several innovative engineering projects, including Boxed Wetlands and Rideshare demand modeling (https://andualemg.github.io/rideshare_demand/ ).<br/><br/>
I am obsessed with applications of Machine learning and Optimization on engineering projects and I enjoy changing complex problems into algorithms and coming up with optimal solutions more than anything.<br/><br/>
Please, feel free to contact me.<br/><br/>

Best wishes!</p>
